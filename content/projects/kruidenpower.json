  "description": "Kruidenpower is a website that showcases the herbal medicine business of [Nicole Trompter](https://nicoletrompetter.nl). The site provides users with essential information about her services, products, and what she can and cannot assist with. Although alternative medicine is not something I would typically use, I found working on this website to be an exciting and informative experience.\n\nKruidenpower was also the first job I undertook as a ZZP'er, and it proved to be a crucial learning opportunity. During the project, I experimented with various platforms and technologies, leading me to discover my preferred technology stack for non-interactive websites. Ultimately, I settled on Nuxt 3, which I hosted on [Netlifyâ€™s platform](https://www.netlify.com/). I also integrated [Decap](https://decapcms.org/) to streamline content management.\n\nI appreciate the simplicity of Nuxt 3 for somewhat static sites such as Kruidenpower. While it may not be suitable for more complex websites or applications requiring authentication, it was perfect for this project!\n\nIn addition to Kruidenpower, I also created a portfolio for Nicole Trompter. Although it was a small website, it was a pleasure to work on. However, I felt that it didn't adequately showcase my skills, so I decided not to include it in my portfolio.\n\nOverall, working on Kruidenpower and Nicole Trompter's portfolio was a fulfilling experience that allowed me to refine my skills and develop a better understanding of my preferred technology stack for non-interactive websites.",
