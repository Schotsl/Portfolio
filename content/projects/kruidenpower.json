  "description": "ZonneVeranda is a website that showcases the products of ZonneVeranda, including the impressive [ZonneVeranda](https://zonneveranda.nl/zonneveranda), [PowerPort](https://zonneveranda.nl/powerport), and [solar panels](https://zonneveranda.nl/zonnepanelen). I leveraged my go-to technology stack for \"non-interactive\" sites, [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/), and hosted it on [Netlify's platform](https://www.netlify.com/). With the addition of [Decap](https://decapcms.org/), content management was made much more streamlined and efficient.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of this project was having the opportunity to help ZonneVeranda demonstrate and promote their products to a wider audience. By creating a website that emphasises the advantages of their products, ZonneVeranda can attract potential customers and demonstrate how their offerings can improve their lives.\n\nThis project was brought to me through [Raphael Kurun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-kurun-776766161), a friend and the owner of [Corvus Consultancy](https://corvusconsultancy.nl). While the client had a design from a previous website, I was able to make necessary modifications to accommodate their new requirements.\n\nAt the time of writing, ZonneVeranda is not yet live, but it's set to launch within the next few weeks, and we are continuously adding new features to improve the website. Overall, it was a delightful project to work on, and I'm thrilled with the outcome. Being a part of such an endeavour is an honour!"
