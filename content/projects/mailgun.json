  "description": "As a passionate user of [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) I faced a challenge when attempting to send emails from my deploy instances due to the platform blocking of commonly used SMTP ports. After exploring options, I turned to [Mailgun's REST API](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api_reference.html) which enabled me to bypass this issue. However, I couldn't find an existing Mailgun package for Deno, and NPM support in Deno was limited at the time.\n\nTo overcome this obstacle, I developed my own Mailgun API wrapper. While this package only covers the mail sending aspect of Mailgun's extensive API, it is fully typed and features a straightforward test script. I take pride in the fact that this project is considered \"done,\" which is a rare achievement for personal projects. The GitHub repository has received four stars. It's fulfilling to know that my code is helping others."
