  "content": "For my girlfriend's birthday, I decided to create a unique and personalized gift. I developed a website where she can sign in to see two spinner wheels. She has three spins to use. When she spins the wheels, they pair a group with an activity, such as â€˜Going bowling with the two of us.'\n\nAfter the initial spin, she has 10 seconds to re-spin either wheel if desired, allowing her to change either the group or the activity. Once the final choice is made, confetti pops, and I receive an email notification, at which point I'll schedule and organize the date!\n\nI built this website using [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication and database, and [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for the email service. I'm thrilled with how this gift turned out and love the colorful look.",
