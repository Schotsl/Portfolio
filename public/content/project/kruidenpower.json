  "content": "Kruidenpower is a website showcasing the herbal medicine business of Nicole Trompetter, designed by [Lanxiang Vermeulen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanxiang-vermeulen-498471185/). I expanded the designs to include mobile devices. Special thanks to [Raphael Kurun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-kurun-776766161/) for connecting me with [Nicole Trompetter](https://nicoletrompetter.nl/). This project taught me a lot about web development and client communication, despite alternative medicine not being my usual area of interest.\n\nKruidenpower was my first job as a freelancer. I used [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) and [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) to create the website. Although I have since transitioned from [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to [React](https://react.dev/) and from Nuxt to [Next](https://nextjs.org/), this project was a valuable learning experience, and I am pleased that the website is still in use.",
