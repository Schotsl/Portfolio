  "content": "I am a big fan of [Plausible](https://plausible.io/), a website analytics service that respects user privacy, and I use it on all of my websites. The best part is that it’s free when self-hosted, which in my case means asking [Wouter de Bruijn](https://wouterdebruijn.nl/) to host it for me. Plausible released an [API](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api), which got me excited about integrating it into my Discord bot and live stat counter for the [Uwuifier](sjorsvanholst.nl/project/uwuifier) website.\n\nAs a [Deno](https://deno.com/) enthusiast, I encountered a problem that I encounter all too often: no Plausible package for Deno existed. So, I wrote one myself. The Plausible API is simple, so I was able to cover the stats reference completely. With [David Brands](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-b-128612132/)’ assistance, I fully typed the API. At some point, I would like to also implement the [Events API](https://plausible.io/docs/events-api) and [Site provisioning API](https://plausible.io/docs/sites-api).\n\nI would also like to give a shoutout to NPM for releasing the Plausible package name to me, as the previous owner had reserved it nine years prior and had not used it since then.",
