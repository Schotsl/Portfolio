  "content": "For my first minor VID (Visual Interface Design) in [CMD](https://cmd-amsterdam.nl/), I had a subject called Typografie. One of our end deliverables for this project was to create a website showcasing the history of a font. The font I chose was Futura.\n\nOn my website, I provided users with information about Futura, including its creation, general details, history, and a showcase of famous use cases, such as its use on the moon! I also implemented a section called ‘Try it yourself.’ In this section, users can enter commands like ‘Make it bolder and curved,’ and it will use Futura and [OpenAI’s API](https://platform.openai.com/) to style the text accordingly, allowing users to easily experiment with Futura.\n\nI created this website using [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), along with OpenAI API for styling the text. This project was also my first time experimenting with [react-scroll-parallax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-parallax), and it was a great experience!",
