  "content": "Me and my nephew Timo Steenmeijer talked a lot about Terschelling while I lived with him and his family for a few months. So we decided to create our own podcast around this subject, which also became an excuse to hang out. Our podcast, “De Terschelling Podcast,” was a bi-weekly journey where we shared stories, discussed news articles and books, and talked about our personal experiences. The joke is, we’re not from Terschelling, and although we've been there a lot on vacations, we don’t actually know much, which hopefully made for a fun take on the island.\n\nWe recorded 13 episodes before putting the podcast on pause for now. During that time, I also built a website to showcase our work. The site is made with Next.js, TypeScript, SCSS, and Decap CMS, and is delivered via Bunny CDN to reduce the load on Vercel. It’s completely statically generated, so it’s very fast. The site includes metadata and a custom-made RSS feed that hosts our podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Podimo.",
