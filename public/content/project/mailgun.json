I encountered a problem when attempting to send emails from my deploy instances due to Deno Deploy blocking commonly used SMTP ports. Initially, I tried setting up a relay, but I prefer to avoid server management at all costs. This led me to use [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) for sending emails.\n\nThe NPM Mailgun package didn’t support Deno at the time, so I created a Mailgun API wrapper native to Deno. This package only covers the mail-sending API, is fully typed, and supports the entire endpoint. I’m glad I limited the Mailgun package to this essential part, as I can consider it “done.”. The package has a few GitHub stars, and it’s nice to know my code is helping someone. I know all too well the feeling of finding the right package when you thought you’d have to do it yourself.",
