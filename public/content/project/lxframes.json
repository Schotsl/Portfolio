She needed a portfolio to showcase her school and professional work while searching for internships, as well as her professional work as a photographer.\n\nLanxiang provided her own designs, which I then turned into a website. I also created the mobile design and made final adjustments. This website was created using [Next](https://nextjs.org/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/) for content management. Her portfolio successfully helped her find an internship, which was very rewarding.",
