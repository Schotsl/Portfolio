  "content": "After I finished my studies and continued work on [Swiftbite](https://sjorsvanholst.nl/project/swiftbite), I was looking through the user feedback and noticed that a lot of users were very impressed with the icon set the app contained. I was glad to hear this, of course, as I had spent quite a lot of time setting this up.\n\n> When I first created the icon flow for Swiftbite, the image generation models were much worse. So I spent a lot of time setting up a fast Docker container and endpoint relay system, along with an image processing pipeline and a validation step to ensure the icons looked good. It took a lot of work to build. During my assignment, OpenAI released gpt-image-1, which made the entire pipeline redundant, as it could generate high-quality, natively transparent images that I could call directly from a Next.js endpoint. That meant I could throw out all my earlier work, which was a very bittersweet experience, even though the icons do look way better now.\n\nI figured other food-tracking apps or services might want to add something similar. The setup I created wouldn't be very hard to recreate for another service, but generating all the icons I already had does cost some money, so I thought I might as well make it available to other people. This way, they only had to add an img tag with the right URLs, and they'd be off to the races.\n\nSo, I turned the icon logic of Swiftbite into a standalone microservice. I created a landing page with some examples, a demo, and very simple API documentation. For now, I consider the service to be in beta, so to obtain an API key, users can contact me and I will provide it!",
