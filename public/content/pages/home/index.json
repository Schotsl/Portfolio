    "content": "Hey! I'm Sjors van Holst, an experienced web developer and a learning web designer. I absolutely love creating websites and mobile apps for a wide variety of use cases, from a fun, simple website to check the swimming weather to a fully-fledged, complex workout app. I love learning and using new technologies, which is confirmed by the fact that I probably refactor old projects a bit too often.\n\nI'm confident that I can help you with many technical and design challenges, from creating a mobile app or company website to improving UX and consulting on an offer or project. Don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:contact@sjorsvanholst.nl).\n\nI've got a broad knowledge of frameworks and tools. I work with Adobe XD, Figma, and Photoshop, with Figma being my preferred prototyping tool. For programming and development, I work with TypeScript and React in Next.js and Supabase, although I've also spent a lot of time with Vue, PHP, WordPress, MySQL, and more!",
