I absolutely love creating websites and mobile apps for a wide variety of use casesâ€”from a fun, simple website to check the swimming weather, to a fully-fledged, complex workout app. I love learning and using new technologies, which is confirmed by the fact that I probably refactor old projects a bit too often...\n\nI'm confident that I can help you with many technical and design challenges, from creating a mobile app or company website, to improving UX and consulting on an offer or project. Don't hesitate to contact me.\n\nI've got a broad knowledge of frameworks and tools; I currently prefer working with TypeScript and React in Next.js and Supabase, although I've also spent a lot of time with Vue, PHP, WordPress, MySQL, and more!",
