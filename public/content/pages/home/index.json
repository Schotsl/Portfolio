    "content": "Hey! I'm Sjors van Holst, an experienced web developer and designer. I recently graduated cum laude from the Communication and Multimedia Design program at the HvA, and I'm now looking for exciting projects or a new job opportunity. I absolutely love creating websites and mobile apps for a wide variety of use cases, from fun, simple websites to check the swimming weather to a more advanced food tracking app, which is my latest project. It's an app I researched, designed, and built from scratch, combining useful features with great UX.\n\nI love learning and using new technologies, which is confirmed by the fact that I probably refactor old projects a bit too often. I'm confident that I can help you with many technical and design challenges, from creating a mobile app or company website to improving UX and consulting on an offer or project. Don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:contact@sjorsvanholst.nl).\n\nI've got a broad knowledge of frameworks and tools. I work with Adobe XD, Figma, and Photoshop, with Figma being my preferred prototyping tool. For programming and development, I love working with TypeScript and React in Next.js and Supabase, and I really enjoy working with Expo as well. I've also spent a lot of time with Vue, PHP, WordPress, MySQL, many different APIs, third party services and more!",
