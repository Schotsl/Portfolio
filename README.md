Check out my portfolio at [sjorsvanholst.nlsjorsvanholst.nl](https://sjorsvanholst.nl). It’s a handpicked showcase of my favorite projects, created to display my skills and introduce my work to potential clients and interested parties. Take a look and see what I’m all about!

I use Next.js for the front end and manage styles with SCSS. The app runs on the Bun runtime for enhanced performance and is hosted on Vercel.

## Getting started

To begin development, clone the repository to your local machine. You'll need Bun installed to run the project. In the project directory, you can install the necessary packages using Bun.

```bash
bun install
```

The next step is to start the development server, which will be hosted at http://localhost:3000.

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Other commands

- `bun run build`: Builds the application for production to the .next folder.
- `bun run start`: Runs the built app in production mode.
- `bun run lint`: Runs Next.js' built-in ESLint.
- `bun run format`: Formats the code using Prettier.

## Deployment

Any commits to the main branch will automatically be deployed to https://sjorsvanholst.nl through Vercel.

## Video

I recorded the videos shown on my portfolio using [ScrollCapture](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scroll-capture/egmhoeaacclmanaimofoooiamhpkimkk) with a scroll speed of 600 px/s and `linear.ease` for the easing setting. The first frame was extracted and used as a thumbnail. The images are hosted and transcoded on [Bunny CDN](https://bunny.net).
