  <div class="about">
    I’m Sjors van Holst, a passionate programmer with a focus on web design and experience in PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, Tensorflow, WordPress and AJAX. I’ve got a calm and friendly attitude with a positive approach, I grew up and live in the Netherlands. I finished primary school and continued to high school, where I was introduced to my first programming languages: Processing!

    After about spending a year learning al the ins and outs of processing I was ready to move on in a different direction. I entered college and started web development. Since I already had experienced programming, I was able to enter a program which is allowing me to complete the study in only 2 years! I was born on March 22, which makes me 19 years old.
